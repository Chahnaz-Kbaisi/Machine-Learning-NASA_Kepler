Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, I created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

The following were used to develop machine learning models: 

# Model 1: Testing Support Vector Classification (SVM)

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that analyze data for the purposes of classification into distinct categories and regression analysis.
